HBase UI with React?
JOLT, Groovy, json path, etc to yield a generic Schema?
Kerberized HBase docker in this very repo?
Supervisord to handle the start/stopping of the Docker container;
Wrap the connections in WebSocket? This would help with DNS and authorization, etc
Devise a scheme to fetch the Kerberos context and transmitting it via SPNEGO/LDAP/SSH etc
Queries HBase via Spark => I can use these schema mappers as well
